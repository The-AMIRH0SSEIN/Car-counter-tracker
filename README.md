2. Install the required modules:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install ultralytics
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. **Tip**: For a faster experience you should run yolo on gpu with cuda
4. If you want to use your own model you should collect dataset from roboflow and train your own yolo model
5. For more confidence with built model of yolo you should use yolov8l or bigger model
